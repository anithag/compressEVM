Blockchain scalability is a well-known issue in the cryptocurrency community.
Clients have to download and store gigabytes of data to be able to mine and verify the transactions successfully.
In this work, we propose to compress the size of \eth{} blockchain by leveraging the structure of blocks and transactions.
A reduced blockchain can enable thin clients  that are constrained by storage and network bandwidth (e.g., IoT, embedded systems),
to operate on the \eth{} blockchain. We take \eth{}'s standard blockchain export file and transform it into a more
efficient custom format. By applying the custom format, we enable general purpose compression algorithms like gzip to perform
as much as $20\%$ better, reducing file size by more than half on \eth{}'s main network.
