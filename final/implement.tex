We implemented our compression scheme as an extension to the Go language implementation of the \eth{} client -- \texttt{go-ethereum}~\cite{go-eth}.
Our main compressor, which is written in Go, reads and parses the blockchain export file,
applys the reorganizations and field optimizations, and writes the compressed format to output.
We also have a python script that talks to the Go program to perform Huffman encoding for EVM bytecode.
We choose python due to limitations of Go when it comes to bit-level and non-byte-aligned operations.

The Go compressor consists of around 350 lines of Go code,
with the python scripts adding an additional 270 lines of code.
