We plan to use 
Morden testnet blockchain~\cite{testnet} for evaluating our compression technique. 
Morden is an alternative blockchain containing 1,797,895 blocks, 98,843 contracts and
4,023,330 transactions.
The blockchain currently takes about 4GB of storage and is representative of
the main blockchain.

Our evaluation plan includes comparing the compression savings on a 
with and without using our customized compression technique. 
We also plan to evaluate the compression and decompression time.
