We plan to tackle the question from both the perspective of the blockchain structure and the EVM bytecode.
If it doesn't work out within the timeframe of the project, we plan to concentrate our effort on the EVM
bytecode compression aspect only.
We have already identified where the bytecode is located in the \eth{} source code, and our approach of
separating opcode and operands should not be too hard to implement.
This is a very concrete part of the project that we are confident that we can finish in time.
