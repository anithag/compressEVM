Blockchain scalability is a well-known issue in the cryptocurrency community.
Clients have to download and store giga bytes of data to be able to mine and verify the transactions successfully.
In this work, we propose to compress the size of ethereum blockchain by leveraging the structure of blocks and transactions.
A reduced blockchain can enable thin clients  that are constrained by storage and network bandwidth (e.g., IoT, embedded systems),
 to operate on the ethereum blockchain.
